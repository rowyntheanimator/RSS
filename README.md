Hello this is a quick warning. Please read this before while you ever run this program as of you must have Python installed along with these following extensions.

pygame
numpy

To import them, you can use these commands

pip install pygame

pip install numpy

These commands do work on both operating systems, Linux and windows. I know there are others, but they also work with them too. Just opened up whatever console window that you use and type in these commands. If you do not have python installed then install it here
